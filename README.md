# COINS - Continuity in Street Networks
This repository contains the source code of the COINS tool that allows to deduce natural continuity of street network. For continuity of streets, the deflection angle between adjacent segments are computed, the user can provide the desired angle threshold. Segments will only be considered a part of the same street if the deflection angle is above the threshold (defaults to zero). Please find details in the paper.<br/>

The image below shows the input street network data from the OSM, and its corresponding output from the COINS tool. For visualisation purpose, classification (natural breaks 'Jenks') was done on the length of the street strokes in the resulting shapefile.<br/>

There are two ways of accessing the tool, one is the Python script, which can be found here [[link]](/PythonTool). Second way of using is the QGIS plugin, source code and details are here [[link]](/QGISplugin).<br/>
